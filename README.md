# Omnifood - Never cook again !
To put into practice everything I learned in [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/) from Jonas Schmedtmann, we created this website. 
It's a simple landing page for a fictitious company that is innovative because it offers dishes to cook generated by artificial intelligence.

## I learn :
- The fundamentals of modern and semantic HTML, CSS, and building layouts in a small separate project, which will prepare you for the main course project Omnifood. This includes modern flexbox and CSS Grid!
- How to design beautiful websites, by learning a web design framework I created just for this course. It consists of easy-to-use guidelines for design aspects like typography, colors, images, spacing, and more (this is like a small standalone course!).
- How to use well-established website components and layout patterns in order to come up with professional-looking designs
- How to make any website work on any mobile device, no matter the design and layout (responsive design)
- How to use the 7 steps of building a professional website in practice: planning, sketching, designing, building, testing, optimizing, and launching
- How to find and use free design assets such as images, fonts, and icons
- Important developer skills such as reading documentation, fixing code errors on your own, and using professional web development tools
- And more !

I recommend this course and the others by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/).
